# US_Accidents_Analysis using RStudio
## Summary
Our project is aimed at analyzing the US traffic accidents data to identify what are the causes of road accidents.It also shows the cities and states where the accidents are occurring. We formulated our hypothesis based on this information of whether weather conditions played a role in the accidents and in which regions of the country are the most accidents occurring. In addition to identifying the reasons for the accidents we also wanted to identify whether there are enough hospitals in the areas to accommodate the increasing number of accidents.


## Data Source

Our dataset comprises of the data regarding the accidents that took place between February 2016 and June 2020 in 49 states of the United States.The dataset contained around 3.5 million records. 

The original US_Accident data can be accessed on: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

The original number of hospitals across United States data can be accessed on: https://www.kaggle.com/carlosaguayo/usa-hospitals

## Project Objectives
The purpose of our analysis is to build a model that focuses on the states where the rate of accidents are highest and are the most severe.
We will use this model in collaboration with the information from the hospital dataset to identify which states are lacking hospital beds so that we can make recommendations to the local government to increase resources and finance to accommodate more beds in those states with the highest severe accidents and help save precious lives.
