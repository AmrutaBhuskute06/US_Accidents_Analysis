# US_Accidents_Analysis
Our project involves analyzing traffic accidents in the United States. Our dataset comprises of the data regarding the accidents that took place between February 2016 and June 2020. We are interested in exploring, how the different weather conditions impact road accidents. Additionally, we want to analyze if there are enough hospitals available in that area to accommodate patients from these accidents. Through this analysis, we are wanting to explore, which states in the US have maximum number of accidents and we also want to study their preparedness to respond to the accidents. We have two null hypotheses that we are looking to analyze about this dataset.  1.Null Hypothesis: - Accidents happening on the east coast are higher.   2.Null Hypothesis: - Accidents happening during extreme weather conditions are higher.
